# virtual-dom-examples

A quick example to demonstrate generation of html output from a JSON based dom. The JSON structure
used is same as the one used in virtual-dom.

The JSON dom is first converted into VNodes and VText and converted to html using
vdom-to-html.

## To run this example
* Clone the repository - git clone https://github.com/harin76/virtual-dom-examples.git
* npm install
* node vdom2html
